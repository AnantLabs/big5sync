#labels Featured

== Features ==

==== Preview Sync Result ====
   This feature will be implemented in the future to show the result before synchronization.

==== Implement uni-directional synchronization ====
   Currently, our software only handles bi-directional synchronization. In the future, Uni directional will be implemented.

==== Implement a Notification system to feedback to the user ====
   Currently, messages from the System Core are not sent to User Interface. We will need to implement a Notification system to send notification to the UI. This is needed to inform the user on many issues, for example, Conflict in Profile, Sync Result etc.

==== Merge Profile for Hard disk. ====
   Currently, the system only merges the profiles from removable drives with the current profile. However, due to some implementation, external hard disk profile does not merge. We are looking into a better design to implement the merging.

==== Configurable Tag ====
   Currently, the system will by default archive the last 5 files. In the future, we will allow the user to customize different settings for archival.

==== More Filters ====
   Currently, Syncless only provides Extension filters. In the future, we will provide more type of filter like size filter and folder filter.

==== Allow naming of Profile ====
   Currently, all profile will be merged. In the future, the user will be able to name their profile and only profile with the same name will be merge.
