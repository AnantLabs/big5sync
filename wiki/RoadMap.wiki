#summary This page contains the list of features/bug fix we will implement in the future.

1. Solve the recursion directory issue.  
   Currently, if the folders that are tagged form a recursion, if all of the tags are in seamless mode, folders and file will be continuously created until the maximum path length is reached. After which, an exception will be thrown.
   Example of recursion : 
   
   <a href = "http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/RecursiveTagging.jpg"><img src = "http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/RecursiveTagging.jpg" /></a>

   If Folder A is tagged with Folder D , and Folder C is tagged with Folder B. 
   

2. Untag a tagged folder if it is deleted.

3. Implement a Notification to send message from Logic Layer to User Interface.

4. Implement a Manual Sync Queue instead of having multiple thread running.

5. Merge Profile for Hard disk.

6. Preview Sync Result.

7. Implement uni-directional synchronization.
