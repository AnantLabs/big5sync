#summary What the user can expect from Syncless in the Future

== Features ==

1. Preview Sync Result.
   This feature will be implemented in the future to show the result before synchronization.

2. Implement uni-directional synchronization.
   Currently, our software only handles bi-directional synchronization. In the future, Uni directional will be implemented.

3. Implement a Notification system to send message from Logic Layer to User Interface.
   Currently, messages from the System Core are not sent to User Interface. We will need to implement a Notification system to send notification to the UI. This is needed to inform the user on many issues, for example, Conflict in Profile, Sync Result etc.

4. Merge Profile for Hard disk.
   Currently, the system only merges the profiles from removable drives with the current profile. However, due to some implementation, external hard disk profile does not merge. We are looking into a better design to implement the merging.
