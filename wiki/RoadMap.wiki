#summary This page contains the list of features/bug fix we will implement in the future.

1. Solve the recursion directory issue.  
   Currently, if the folders that are tagged form a recursion, if all of the tags are in seamless mode, folders and files will be continuously created until the maximum path length is reached. After which, an exception will be thrown.
   Example of recursion : 
   
   <img src = "http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/RecursiveTagging.jpg" />

   Folder A is tagged with Folder D , and Folder C is tagged with Folder B. 
   

2. Untag a tagged folder if it is deleted.

3. Implement a Notification system to send message from Logic Layer to User Interface.
   Currently, messages from the System Core are not sent to User Interface. We will need to implement a Notification system to send notification to the UI. This is needed to inform the user on many issues, for example, Conflict in Profile, Sync Result etc.
   
4. Implement a Manual Sync Queue instead of having multiple threads running.
   Currently, every sync request is created as a thread and the sync job will be run. However, this may cause many problems when writing meta data and updating file. In the future, a Queue may be implemented to allow only 1 job to be sync at one time.

5. Merge Profile for Hard disk.
   Currently, the system only merges the profiles from removable drives with the current profile. However, the external hard disk is not considered as a removable drive. Therefore, the profiling.xml file on the external hard disk will not be detected, and hence will not be merged with the current profile when it is plugged in to the computer.

   In the future, we will ensure that the system will be able to merge profiles stored in external hard disk, thumbdrive and SD card.

6. Preview Sync Result.

7. Implement uni-directional synchronization.
