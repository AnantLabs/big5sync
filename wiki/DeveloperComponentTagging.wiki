#summary Developer's Guide - Component - Tagging

= Tagging =

== Overview ==

The Tagging component provides the underlying operations of creating/removing a tag, tagging/untagging a folder to/from a tag, managing filter properties and configuring tag properties.

== Class Diagram ==

The Tagging component consists of several important sub-components, including a main logic layer - *TaggingLayer*, model objects - *TaggingProfile*, *Tag*, *TaggedPath* and *TagConfig*, helper components - *TagMerger*, *TaggingHelper* and *TaggingXMLHelper*.

=== TaggingLayer ===

This is the main logic layer which is called by the *SystemLogicLayer* to perform tag-related operations. When initialized, *TaggingLayer* will call *TaggingXMLHelper* to load the current tagging profile from <a href = "#xmldocument">_tagging.xml_</a> in the computer.
