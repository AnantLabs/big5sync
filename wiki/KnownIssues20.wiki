These are the current known issues with Syncless 2.0, and will be handled at a later version. For a list of how Syncless handles certain unique sequence of actions, please look at [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/SpecialCases here].

Note: As much as we try to keep this page updated, please take a look at the project's [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/list issue tracker] before reporting any bugs, thank you.

= General =

== Errors Accessing Some Hard Disks ==

There might be errors accessing some hard disks. See [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=40 Issue 40] for more information

== Exception Thrown At Program Start Up Randomly ==

Sometimes unhandled exception is thrown at program start up. We are still looking into it.Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=185 Issue 185]

== Cannot Sync File With Very Long Name ==

As of version 1.0, the file/folder with !PathTooLongException will simply not be synced. No error will be thrown. Will try to implement a notification to inform user of such error in future releases. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=8 Issue 8]

== Unable to Handle External Disk With Not Enough Space ==

If an external disk runs out of space during synchronization in seamless mode, program will encounter problem.

= Profiling =

== Unable to Load Profile from Protected Removable Drive ==

Syncless cannot access some of the protected removable drives to retrieve guid.id or write metadata into the drive.

= Tagging =

== Recursive Tagging ==

If Folder A is tagged with Folder D and Folder B is tagged with Folder C, a recursion will occur and folders will be created in them until they hit the maximum file path length.

Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=6 Issue 6]
= !CompareAndSync =

== Finalizing Can be Optimized ==

Finalizing can be optimized further. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=178 Issue 178]
= Monitor =

== Errors Detecting Tagged Folder Deletion in Seamless Mode==

The result of this is random. Sometimes !UnauthorizedAccessException will be thrown while in some occasions program works fine.

== Drive Plugin Unstable ==

Most of the time, program can detect drive plugin event. Once in a while, such event is not detected. If that happen , we suggest the user restart syncless. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=192 Issue 192] for more information.

== Removable Drive ==

Plugging in a drive or plugging out a drive while a sync is in progress may produce a unexpected synchronization result.

== Seamless Synchronization Limitation ==

Due to limitation of the `FileSystemWatcher`, when performing mass filesystem operation within a short period of time in seamless synchronization, some files/folders may not be propagated. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=179 Issue 179]

= User Interface =

== Progress Bar Remains on Screen after Tags are removed ==

Sometime progress bar still remains on screen after tags are removed. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=201 Issue 201]

== Changes Made After Every Sync Not Shown ==

Currently, the program does not show a list of changes made to the filesystem after every synchronization. Refer to [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/issues/detail?id=148 Issue 148]

== Tag Properties Panel ==

The tag properties panel only contains the filter property as of version 2.0. It may be confusing to the user at first when he tries to create filters. It is implemented this way so that it is easier to extend the properties panel in future releases. 

== Tagging From Shell During Synchronizing ==

Tagging from the shell (Right-click on a folder) and tagging/untagging while any tag is synchronizing will cause the program to go into a hang state. After some time without interference when all the synchronization operations have been completed, the tagging/untagging window might be shown.

== Unable to detect U3 Partitions ==

Syncless is unable to detect U3 partitions on a thumbdrive. This means that features like tagging and unmonitoring will not be available for it.

== Datagrid Rendering Issue ==

Slight rendering issue on Log Window. The log table might automatically resize after scrolling the window, most likely due to a custom component bug.
