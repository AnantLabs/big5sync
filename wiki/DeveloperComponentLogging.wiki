== Overview ==

The Logging component performs logging of messages produced when exceptions are caught to a debug log file. It also logs user actions to a user log file.

== The Classes ==

The Logging component makes use of a third-party Dynamic Link Library (DLL), _log4net.dll_, to perform logging.

=== LoggingLayer ===

This is the main logic layer which is called by *SystemLogicLayer* to perform logging. A logger object is instantiated and returned to *SystemLogicLayer* when *SystemLogicLayer* call *GetLogger* method of *LoggingLayer*.

=== Logger ===

There are two types of logger object, namely the debug log and the user log. When instantiated, a name is passed to the constructor to indicate whether it is a debug log or a user log.
