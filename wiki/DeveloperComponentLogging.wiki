= Overview =

The *Logging* component is in charge of handling all user and debug logging actions. It is implemented using log4net with the Decorator pattern.

= Classes =

The Logging component makes use of a third-party Dynamic Link Library (DLL), _log4net.dll_, to perform logging.

== !LoggingLayer ==

This is the main logic layer which is called by `SystemLogicLayer` to perform logging. A logger object is instantiated and returned to `SystemLogicLayer` when `SystemLogicLayer` call `GetLogger` method of `LoggingLayer`.

== Logger ==

There are two types of logger object, namely the debug log and the user log. When instantiated, a name is passed to the constructor to indicate whether it is a debug log or a user log.

= Extending Logging =
Logging uses decorator pattern. This allows the developers to extend the method to do pre-processing and post-processing tasks before writing the log.
