== Overview ==
Filter Layer provide a set of classes to cater to filtering folders and files. They can be used to filter default .syncless configuration files as well as archive file.

== Description of Design ==
Filter is based on the factory pattern. The FilterFactory is used to create all the Filter. This is to provide an ease of use for developer to create different type of filter. Since all the filter will be used as Filter object and therefore the developer does not need to use the concrete class.

== Extending Filter ==
Extending Filter can be easily done. It can be extended by created Custom Filter that extend Filter class. The developer need to only implement the Match method. If the developer only want to apply the Filter to Files, he/she can extend the FileFilter object instead. It will ensure that folders will pass through. The user can then edit the FilterFactory to create more type of filter. However, if the developer do not want to change the implementation of the System Core, he/she can choose to extend the FilterFactory instead.

== Side Note ==
Ideally, Filter should only be applied to physical address (i.e C:/Lecture/) and not logical address (address stored in the logical layer). However if the Filter does not need the file address, it is still fine to apply it to logical address.
