=== What is Syncless ? ===

Syncless is a tagged-based file Synchronization tool that provide seamless synchronization for multiple folders. 

 
=== My Syncless fail to initialize. ===

There are many causes for Syncless to fail to initialize. Some of the possible cases are :
# Syncless do not have read/write access to some of the harddisk. Syncless require read/write access on the root folder of the disk that the you tag. 

# Syncless requires .Net Framework 3.5 *SP1* to run. Please ensure that you have the required version. 

=== The profiles refuse to die after deleting the profile files. ===

Syncless save profile in many area to assist in merging of the profiles across multiple computer and thumbdrive. It also allow Syncless to recover some of yours tag in case profiles are not saved properly. Profiles are saved in the following location
# Application folder of Syncless;
# All drives that is identified by Syncless. It is contain in the folder .syncless (i.e C:\.syncless)

The list of profile are tagging.xml and profiling.xml.

However, you should not delete the profile directly.

=== OMG The tags are merging when i don't want them to ===

Syncless currently does not provide the user option to change their profile name. However, if you are interested in helping us test the feature, you can modify tagging.xml and profiling.xml directly and changing the profile name to the one you like. It will then means that only profile with similar name will be merged. However, this features is still in testing mode and may caused unexpected results.

=== Who are we ? ===

We are a group of student from [http://www.nus.edu.sg National University of Singapore] that took a software engineering module, and this is our school project. We decide that it should not be just a school project, so we took a step ahead and created Syncless.
