= Overview =

The *Notification* component provides a low coupling medium for the control layer to pass information to the *User Interface*. It also allows the lower facade layer to pass information to the Logic layer.

= Classes =

The main important classes for Notification include `NotificationQueue` and `INotificationQueue`. Many notification is implemented in both UI and *System Logic Layer*. At UI layer, it needs to implement watchers to watch all notifications which belong to the `Notification.UINotification` namespace.

_Notification that is currently Implemented_
 #  `AutoSyncCompleteNotification` - Inform the User Interface that an auto Sync request is completed.
 #  `NothingToSyncNotification` - Inform the User Interface that there is Nothing to Sync
 #  `SyncCompleteNotification` - Inform the User Interface that the Sync is complete.
 #  `SyncStartNotification` - Inform the User Interface that the Sync is started.



= Description of Design =

The notification layer makes use of observer pattern to notify its watchers to resume their threads if new notification is added to the queue. 

= Extending Notification =

To include more notifications, developers can add more enumerators to the `!NotificationCode` enumeration and extend the `AbstractNotification` class.
