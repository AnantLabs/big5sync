= Overview =

The *Notification* component provides a set of classes to send event notifications internally and as a feedback to the user. Such events may include initiating a synchronization process, monitoring/unmonitoring of a tag, adding/removing a tag and many more. All notifications are enqueued for further actions by the relevant components for internal operations and for the *User Interface* component to provide corresponding feedback to the user.
