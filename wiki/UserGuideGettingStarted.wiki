File Synchronization is taken on a whole new level with _*Syncless*_. This document familiarizes you with the basic features in _*Syncless*_ and introduces you to the concepts of *tagging* and *n-way* _seamless synchronization_ in _*Syncless*_.

_*Syncless*_ allows you to synchronize your files and folders automatically through the use of tags, even across removable drives. With _*Syncless*_, you can quickly tag multiple folders and configure them to be either in _seamless_ mode or _manual_ synchronization mode. Syncless also includes powerful filters and versioning capability, along with the finest usability that caters to individual's workflow. Lastly, Syncless is a portable app, so it will run off any removable drive and no installation is required.

Syncless offers other powerful features to do synchronization. Check out
one or more of these additional features:

  * *Filtering*:  Use Syncless's filtering features for the ultimate control in synchronization. Currently, Syncless is able to include or exclude files and folders by extension and path. Other filters will be available in later versions.

  * *Eject removable drives*: Syncless cares about the safety of your removable drives. It allows for all current synchronization jobs linked to a removable drive to be stopped (Currently only Seamless Operations are Stopped) and thus allow them to be safely removed from removable drives without any data loss.
