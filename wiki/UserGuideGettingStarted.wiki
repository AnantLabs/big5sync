= Welcome to Syncless =

Synchronization is taken on a whole new level with _*Syncless*_. This document familiarizes you with the basic features in _*Syncless*_ and introduces you to the concepts of *tagging* and *n-way* _seamless synchronization_ in _*Syncless*_.

_*Syncless*_ allows you to synchronize your files and folders automatically through the use of tags, even across removable drives. With _*Syncless*_, you can quickly tag multiple folders and configure them to be either in _seamless_ or _manual_ synchronization mode. Syncless also includes powerful filters and versioning capability, along with the finest usability that caters to each individual's workflow. Lastly, Syncless is a portable application, so it will run off any removable drive with no installation required.

== What is a Tag? ==

The concept of *Tag* is not uncommon today. In Syncless's context, it is simply an identity or a label associated with folders you want to keep in sync. Associate several folders to the same tag name, and Syncless will keep them all in sync for you. We will discuss the ways to tagging folders in the subsequent section of this tutorial.

== What You'll Learn ==
If you follow all the steps in this tutorial, youâ€™ll be able to:
  * Synchronize files/folders between the computer and a removable drive

  * Tag in multiple ways

  * Manage tags

  * Prepare removable drives for removal

  * Learn basic shortcuts to speed up productivity


== What You'll Need ==
Before continuing, make sure you have fulfill the following:
  * Running a Windows Operating System (XP and Above). 
  * .NET 3.5 SP2 Framework installed (Get from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx)

To download Syncless, please visit http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/downloads/list to get the latest version (ver 0.9) of Syncless. After that, unzip the package to anywhere and run Syncless.exe. Absolutely no installation of Syncless is required.

To make it easier to do the tasks in this tutorial, it is a good idea to print this document before you start. In some tasks shown in this tutorial, you will need to choose toolbar commands, which looks like this:
Toolbar > Create Tag

The term after Toolbar is the name of the command in the main toolbar located in the Main Window.


== The Syncless Interface ==
When you run Syncless, you will be greeted with the main window, which allows you to choose what you want to do next, such as create tag, tag a folder, view tag details or etc. The interface also incorporates a lot of useful shortcuts to speed up productivity.

You have folders on your computer and thumbdrive that you wish to synchronize automatically without putting too much effort in doing it. Now is the time to use Syncless to help you organise them by using tags.

== 1. Tag Folders ==

To synchronize 2 or more folders together, you must first tag them with the same name. This tagging process can be initiated in multiple ways.

=== Multiple ways of tagging a folder ===

    * Tagging from Syncless (Can also use the keyboard shortcut equivalent Ctrl-T, refer to [UserGuideGettingStarted#Misc:_Keyboard_Shortcuts keyboard shortcuts] for a complete list of shortcuts)

    * Drag-and-Drop folder(s) on the Main Window

    * Tagging from Windows Explorer

== 2. Viewing tag information ==
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_Info_Panel.jpg

After tagging the folders, you may view the details under the tag information panel. You will see a list of folder paths associated with the selected tag. On the right of the folder path list, there are a few options for synchronization. During synchronization, the progress bar will show the percentage of completion and status of the synchronization.

== 3. Synchronize the folders ==

After you have tagged the required folders, click on the *Sync Now* button. Syncless will take care of the rest and keep the folders in sync.

== 4. Switch to Seamless Mode ==

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Switching_To_Seamless.jpg

Switching to seamless modes is a simple matter of pressing the button. After clicking the synchronization mode button, Syncless will automatically perform a synchronization. After which, it will monitor any changes in the tagged folders and keep them in sync without you having to do it manually.


== 5. Prepare Removable Drive for Removal ==

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Unmonitor_Drive.jpg

You can access this from the Toolbar > Unmonitor or by using its keyboard shortcut equivalent (Ctrl-I)

Syncless cares about the safety of your removable drives. It allows for all current synchronization jobs linked to a removable drive to be *stopped* (only seamless operations will be stopped so far) and thus allow the removable drive to be safely removed.

== You can start using Syncless now! ==

With the successful operation of synchronization, you have now completed the full Syncless tutorial. Continue on to see other major features in Syncless.

Syncless offers other powerful features. These additional features include:

  * *N-way Synchronization*: Why restrict yourself to just syncing two folders? Let Syncless perform n-way synchronization between multiple folders for you.

  * *Filtering*:  Use Syncless's filtering features for the ultimate control in synchronization. Currently, Syncless is able to include or exclude files and folders by extension and path. Other filters will be available in later versions.

 * *Archiving*: Syncless archives files and folders which have been removed. Every file and folder will be archived up to 5 backups at one time. As of version 1.0, archiving is not user-configurable, but will be in the future.

 * *Portability*: Be the ultimate on-the-go warrior and carry Syncless on your thumb-drive instead of leaving it on your computer.

== N-way Synchronization ==
Traditionally, to keep a few folders in sync, you need to create multiple jobs because many tools provide synchronization between 2 folders only. Syncless is capable of synchronizing multiple folders without having you to create multiple jobs. Simply create one tag and tag multiple folders to the same tag, then Syncless will keep them all in sync.

== Filtering ==
Syncless provides basic filtering for files currently. There are 2 main kinds of filters, inclusion and exclusion filters. Exclusion filters will always have a higher priority over inclusion filters. In this section, we are going to take a look at how we can construct some filters to suit our needs.

=== Create a Filter ===
Click on either the folder icon or the details icon in the toolbar to open up the filter panel. You should see a list of filters, and most likely, it will be blank since no filters have been added yet.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Configure_Filter.jpg

Now, click on "+" to add a new filter. You can now set the "Ext. Mask" and the "Mode".

=== Construct a Filter ===
Ext. mask can be an actual filename, or simply a name with wildcards. Some examples will be "Storyboard.ppt", "`*`.exe" or "File?.txt".

  * *`*`* - Wildcard for any number of characters. For example, s`*`t will mean sit, sat, shoot, skit, etc.

  * *?* Wildcard for exactly one character. For example, s?t  will mean sit, sat, etc.

Mode can be set to exclusion or inclusion mode. If a filter is set to exclusion mode, then all files that match the ext. mask will be excluded. On the contrary, if a filter is set to inclusion mode, then all files matching the ext. mask will be included.

Now, let us look at some real-world examples. For example, if you want to include all Powerpoint files, but exclude a particular one, say "Introduction.ppt", you will create 2 filters:

  # Ext. Mask: `*`.ppt, Mode: Inclusion
  # Ext. Mask: Introduction.ppt, Mode: Exclusion

As seen from the above, creating a filter is a simple and intuitive task in Syncless.

== Archiving ==
With the archiving feature, you do not need to worry about losing an important file if you accidentally delete it and the change is propagated to other folders in the same tag. Syncless will keep up to 5 copies of the deleted file in an archive folder. This folder will be created in all the other folders in the same tag. Note that it will not be created in the folder where the file deletion is initiated by the user.

To illustrate, let's say you tag D:\Lecture and E:\Notes to a tag named 'Lecture', both contain the file Chapter1.pdf. You accidentally delete Chapter1.pdf under D:\Lecture. Syncless will keep a copy of Chapter1.pdf in the archive folder under E:\Notes. If you need to restore that file, simply copy the archived file back to D:\Lecture.

== Portability ==
If you frequently use your removable storage drive on various computers, Syncless can automate this job for you. For example, a student has a home computer, as well as a regular workstation in his school lab. He wishes to keep his school work synchronized across both computers. By having Syncless on both his home computer and school workstation, and giving them the same tag, say "Lectures", Syncless will auto-detect and synchronize each time the removable storage drive is inserted. See the below diagrams for a clearer illustration:
