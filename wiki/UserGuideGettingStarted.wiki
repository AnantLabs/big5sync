= Welcome to Syncless =

Synchronization is taken on a whole new level with _*Syncless*_. This document familiarizes you with the basic features in _*Syncless*_ and introduces you to the concepts of *tagging* and *n-way* _seamless synchronization_ in _*Syncless*_.

_*Syncless*_ allows you to synchronize your files and folders automatically through the use of tags, even across removable drives. With _*Syncless*_, you can quickly tag multiple folders and configure them to be either in _seamless_ or _manual_ synchronization mode. Syncless also includes powerful filters and versioning capability, along with the finest usability that caters to individual's workflow. Lastly, Syncless is a portable app, so it will run off any removable drive and no installation is required.

== What You’ll Learn ==
If you follow all the steps in this tutorial, you’ll be able to:
  * Synchronize files/folders between the computer and a removable drive

  * Tag in multiple ways

  * Manage tags

  * Prepare removable drives for removal

  * Learn basic shortcuts to speed up productivity

== Downloading and Running ==
Before continuing, make sure you are running a Windows operating system (XP and above has been tested so far to be working well).

To download Syncless, please visit http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/downloads/list to get the latest version (ver 0.9) of Syncless. After that, unzip the package to anywhere and run Syncless.exe. Absolutely no installation of Syncless is required.

To make it easier to do the tasks in this tutorial, it is a good idea to print this document before you start. In some tasks shown in this tutorial, you will need to choose toolbar commands, which looks like this:
Toolbar > Create Tag

The term after Toolbar is the name of the command in the main toolbar located in the Main Window.

== The Syncless Interface ==
When you run Syncless, you will be greeted with the main window, which allows you to choose what you want to do next, such as create tag, tag a folder, view tag details or etc. The interface also incorporates a lot of useful shortcuts to speed up productivity.

You have folders on your computer and thumbdrive that you wish to synchronize automatically without putting too much effort in doing it. Now is the time to use Syncless to help you organise them by using tags.

== Step 1: Tag Folders ==

To synchronize 2 or more folders together, you must first tag them with the same name. This tagging process can be initiated in multiple ways.
  * Tagging from Syncless (Can also use the keyboard shortcut equivalent Ctrl-T, refer to [UserGuideGettingStarted#Misc:_Keyboard_Shortcuts] for a complete list of shortcuts)

  * Drag-and-Drop folder(s) on the Main Window

  * Tagging from Windows Explorer

We will tag both the folder on the computer and on the thumbdrive from Windows Explorer.

1. Tagging local folder from Windows Explorer

3. Drag and drop the removable drive folder to tag

4. Tagging is complete and synchronization begins

== Step 2: Switch to Manual Mode ==

Switching to manual modes is a simple matter of pressing the button. After switching, additional operations in manual synchronization such as 'Preview of Manual Synchronization' (Not Implemented in UI yet) and 'Starting Manual Synchronization' will be displayed.


== Step 3: Prepare Removable Drive for Removal ==

You can access this from the Toolbar > Eject or by using its keyboard shortcut equivalent (Ctrl-E)

Syncless cares about the safety of your removable drives. It allows for all current synchronization jobs linked to a removable drive to be stopped (Currently in Ver 0.9, only seamless operations are stopped) and thus allow the removable drive to be safely removed.

With the successful operation of synchronization, you have now completed the full Syncless tutorial. Continue on to see other major features in Syncless.


== Continue to Explore Syncless ==

Syncless offers other powerful features. Check out one or more of these additional features:

  * *N-way Synchronization*: Why restrict yourself to just syncing two folders? Let Syncless perform n-way synchronization between multiple folders for you.

  * *Filtering*:  Use Syncless's filtering features for the ultimate control in synchronization. Currently, Syncless is able to include or exclude files and folders by extension and path. Other filters will be available in later versions.

 * *Archiving*: Syncless archives files and folders which have been removed. Every file and folder will be archived up to 5 backups at one time. As of version 0.9, archiving is not user-configurable, but will be in the future.

 * *Portability*: Be the ultimate on-the-go warrior and carry Syncless on your thumb-drive instead of leaving it on your computer.
