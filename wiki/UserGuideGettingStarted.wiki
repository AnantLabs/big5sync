= Welcome to Syncless =

Synchronization is taken on a whole new level with _*Syncless*_. This document familiarizes you with the basic features in _*Syncless*_ and introduces you to the concepts of *tagging* and *n-way* _seamless synchronization_ in _*Syncless*_.

_*Syncless*_ allows you to synchronize your files and folders automatically through the use of tags, even across removable drives. With _*Syncless*_, you can quickly tag multiple folders and configure them to be either in _seamless_ or _manual_ synchronization mode. Syncless is designed to have the finest usability that caters to each individual's workflow. Lastly, Syncless is a portable application, so it will run off any removable drive with no installation required.

== Why use Syncless? ==

Why choose Syncless over other synchronization tools? The reason is simple. Syncless provides many powerful features which are rarely found in one single synchronization tool in the market.

  * *N-way Synchronization*: Why restrict yourself to just syncing two folders? Let Syncless perform n-way synchronization between multiple folders for you.

  * *Filtering*:  Use Syncless's filtering features for the ultimate control in synchronization. Currently, Syncless is able to include or exclude files and folders by extension and path. Other filters will be available in later versions.

 * *Archiving*: Syncless archives files and folders which have been removed. Every file and folder will be archived up to 2 backups at one time. As of version 1.0, archiving is not user-configurable, but will be in the future.

 * *Portability*: Be the ultimate on-the-go warrior and carry Syncless on your thumb-drive instead of leaving it on your computer.

=== N-way Synchronization ===
Traditionally, to keep a few folders in sync, you need to create multiple jobs because many tools provide synchronization between 2 folders only. Syncless is capable of synchronizing multiple folders without having you to create multiple jobs. Simply create one tag and tag multiple folders to the same tag, then Syncless will keep them all in sync.

=== Filtering ===
Syncless provides basic filtering for files currently. There are 2 main kinds of filters, inclusion and exclusion filters. Exclusion filters will always have a higher priority over inclusion filters. In this section, we are going to take a look at how we can construct some filters to suit our needs.

=== Archiving ===
With the archiving feature, you do not need to worry about losing an important file if you accidentally delete it and the change is propagated to other folders in the same tag. Syncless will keep up to 2 copies of the deleted file in an archive folder. This folder will be created in all the other folders in the same tag. Note that it will not be created in the folder where the file deletion is initiated by the user.

To illustrate, let's say you tag D:\Lecture and E:\Notes to a tag named 'Lecture', both contain the file Chapter1.pdf. You accidentally delete Chapter1.pdf under D:\Lecture. Syncless will keep a copy of Chapter1.pdf in the archive folder under E:\Notes. If you need to restore that file, simply copy the archived file back to D:\Lecture.

=== Portability ===
If you frequently use your removable storage drive on various computers, Syncless can automate this job for you. For example, a student has a home computer, as well as a regular workstation in his school lab. He wishes to keep his school work synchronized across both computers. By having Syncless on both his home computer and school workstation, and giving them the same tag, say "Lectures", Syncless will auto-detect and synchronize each time the removable storage drive is inserted. See the below diagrams for a clearer illustration:

== What is a Tag? ==

The concept of *tagging* is not uncommon today. In Syncless's context, it is simply an identity or a label associated with folders you want to keep in sync. Associate several folders to the same tag name, and Syncless will keep them all in sync for you. It is as simple as that. You simply tag the folders you want to keep in sync, and Syncless will handle everything else. We will discuss the various ways of tagging folders in the subsequent section of this tutorial.

== How to Tag and Synchronize? ==

You have folders on your computer and removable drives that you wish to synchronize automatically. Let us get started on using Syncless! 

=== 1. Tag Folders ===

To synchronize 2 or more folders, you must first tag them with the same name. This tagging process can be initiated in multiple ways.

==== Tagging from Syncless ==== 

Tag a folder through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/tagbuttonicon.jpg button (You can also use the keyboard shortcut equivalent Ctrl-T. Please refer to [UserGuideGettingStarted#Misc:_Keyboard_Shortcuts keyboard shortcuts] for a complete list of shortcuts)
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_From_Syncless.jpg

==== Drag-and-Drop Folder(s) into the Main Window ====

==== Tag Directly from Windows Explorer ====

=== 2. Viewing Tag Information ===
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_Info_Panel_Edited.jpg

After tagging the folders, you may view the details under the tag information panel through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/detailsbuttonicon.jpg button. You will see a list of folder paths associated with the selected tag. On the right of the folder path list, there are a few options for synchronization. During synchronization, the progress bar will show the percentage of completion and status of the synchronization.

=== 3. Synchronize the Folders ===
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Sync_Complete.jpg

After you have tagged the required folders, click on the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Sync_Now_Button.jpg button. Syncless will take care of the rest and keep the folders in sync.

=== 4. Switch to Seamless Mode ===

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Switching_To_Seamless.jpg

Switching to seamless mode is a simple matter of pressing the button. After clicking the synchronization mode button, Syncless will automatically perform an initial synchronization. After which, it will monitor any changes in the tagged folders and keep them in sync without you having to do it manually.


=== 5. Unmonitor Removable Drive to Prepare for Removal ===

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Unmonitor_Drive.jpg

You can access this through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/unmonitorbuttonicon.jpg button or by using its keyboard shortcut equivalent (Ctrl-I).

Syncless cares about the safety of your removable drives. Unmonitoring will stop all monitoring actions on any folders that are currently in seamless mode, and thus allow the removable drive to be safely removed.


=== 6. Configure Filter Properties ===

==== Create a Filter ====
Click the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/detailsbuttonicon.jpg button in the toolbar to open up the tag properties panel. Inside the properties panel, choose the *Filtering* property. You should see a list of filters , and it will likely be blank since no filters have been added yet.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_Configuration.jpg

Now, click on the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Add_Filter_Button.jpg button to add a new filter. You can now set the "Ext. Mask" and the "Mode".

==== Construct a Filter ====
Ext. mask can be an actual filename, or simply a name with wildcards. Some examples will be "Storyboard.ppt", "`*`.exe" or "File?.txt".

  * *`*`* - Wildcard for any number of characters. For example, s`*`t will mean sit, sat, shoot, skit, etc.

  * *?* Wildcard for exactly one character. For example, s?t  will mean sit, sat, etc.

Mode can be set to exclusion or inclusion mode. If a filter is set to exclusion mode, then all files that match the ext. mask will be excluded. On the contrary, if a filter is set to inclusion mode, then all files matching the ext. mask will be included.

Now, let us look at some real-world examples. For example, if you want to include all Powerpoint files, but exclude a particular one, say "Introduction.ppt", you will create 2 filters:

  # Ext. Mask: `*`.ppt, Mode: Inclusion
  # Ext. Mask: Introduction.ppt, Mode: Exclusion

As seen from the above, creating a filter is a simple and intuitive task in Syncless.
