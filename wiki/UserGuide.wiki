= Preface =

This user's guide provides a detailed insight into the functionalities available in *_Syncless_*. If you wish to have a quick view on the basic functions provided in *_Syncless_*, you can refer to the *Getting Started* section [#Getting_Started here].

= Welcome to Syncless =

Synchronization is taken on a whole new level with _*Syncless*_. This document familiarizes you with the basic features in _*Syncless*_ and introduces you to the concepts of *tagging* and *n-way* _seamless synchronization_ in _*Syncless*_.

_*Syncless*_ allows you to synchronize your files and folders automatically through the use of tags, even across removable drives. With _*Syncless*_, you can quickly tag multiple folders and configure them to be either in _seamless_ or _manual_ synchronization mode. Syncless is designed to have the finest usability that caters to each individual's workflow. Lastly, Syncless is a portable application, so it will run off any removable drive with no installation required.

== Why Use Syncless? ==

Why choose Syncless over other synchronization tools? The reason is simple. Syncless provides many powerful features which are rarely found in one single synchronization tool in the market.

  * *N-way Synchronization*: Why restrict yourself to just syncing two folders? Let Syncless perform n-way synchronization between multiple folders for you.

  * *Filtering*:  Use Syncless's filtering features for the ultimate control in synchronization. Currently, Syncless is able to include or exclude files and folders by extension and path. Other filters will be available in later versions.

  * *Archiving*: Syncless archives files and folders which have been removed. Every file and folder will be archived up to 2 backups at one time. As of version 1.0, archiving is not user-configurable, but will be in the future.

  * *Portability*: Be the ultimate on-the-go warrior and carry Syncless on your thumb-drive instead of leaving it on your computer.

  * *Time Synchronization*:

=== N-way Synchronization ===
The traditional way to keep a few folders in sync is to create multiple jobs because many tools provide synchronization between 2 folders only. Syncless is capable of synchronizing multiple folders without you having to create multiple jobs. Simply tag multiple folders with the same tag name and Syncless will keep them all in sync. 

=== Filtering ===
Syncless currently provides basic filtering capabilities for files. There are 2 main kinds of filters, inclusion and exclusion filters. Exclusion filters will always have a higher priority over inclusion filters. In this section, we are going to take a look at how we can construct filters to suit our needs.

=== Archiving ===
With the archiving feature, you do not need to worry about losing an important file if you accidentally delete it and the change is propagated to other folders in the same tag. Syncless will keep up to 2 copies of the deleted file in an archive folder. This folder will be created in all the other folders in the same tag. Note that the file itself will not be archived in the folder where the file deletion is initiated by the user.

To illustrate, let us say you tag D:\Lecture and E:\Notes to a tag named 'Lecture', both containing the file Chapter1.pdf. You accidentally deleted Chapter1.pdf under D:\Lecture. Syncless will keep a copy of Chapter1.pdf in the archive folder under E:\Notes. If you need to restore that file, simply copy the archived file back to D:\Lecture. 

=== Portability ===
Syncless can run from a removable drive such as a thumbdrive. If you frequently use your removable storage drive for the purpose of synchronizing files and folders on various computers, Syncless can automate this job for you. 

For example, a student has a home computer, as well as a regular workstation in his school lab. He wishes to keep his school work synchronized across both computers. By tagging his school work folders on both his home computer and school workstation with the same tag, say "Lectures", Syncless will auto-detect and synchronize each time the removable storage drive is inserted. See the diagrams below for a clearer illustration:

=== Time Synchronization ===

== What is a Tag? ==

The concept of *tagging* is not uncommon today. In Syncless's context, it is simply an identity or a label associated with folders you want to keep in sync. Associate several folders to the same tag name, and Syncless will keep them all in sync for you. It is as simple as that. You simply tag the folders you want to keep in sync, and Syncless will handle everything else. We will discuss the various ways of tagging folders in the subsequent section of this tutorial.


== What You'll Need ==

== How to Tag and Synchronize? ==

You have folders on your computer and removable drives that you wish to synchronize automatically. Let us get started on using Syncless! 

=== 1. Tag Folders ===

To synchronize 2 or more folders, you must first tag them with the same name. This tagging process can be initiated in multiple ways.

==== Tagging from Syncless ==== 

Tag a folder through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/tagbuttonicon.jpg button (You can also use the keyboard shortcut equivalent Ctrl-T.)
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_From_Syncless.jpg

==== Drag-and-Drop Folder(s) into the Main Window ====
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Drag_And_Drop_Tag_Edited.jpg

==== Tag Directly from Windows Explorer ====
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_From_Context_Menu_Edited.png

=== 2. View Tag Information ===
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_Info_Panel_Edited.jpg

After tagging the folders, you may view the details under the tag information panel through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/detailsbuttonicon.jpg button. You will see a list of folder paths associated with the selected tag. On the right of the folder path list, there are a few options for synchronization. During synchronization, the progress bar will show the percentage of completion and status of the synchronization.

=== 3. Synchronize the Folders ===
    http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Sync_Complete.jpg

After you have tagged the required folders, click on the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Sync_Now_Button.jpg button. Syncless will take care of the rest and keep the folders in sync.

=== 4. Switch to Seamless Mode ===

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Switching_To_Seamless.jpg

Switching to seamless mode is a simple matter of pressing the button. After clicking the synchronization mode button, Syncless will automatically perform an initial synchronization. After which, it will monitor any changes in the tagged folders and keep them in sync without you having to do it manually.

=== 5. Unmonitor Removable Drive to Prepare for Removal ===

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Unmonitor_Drive.jpg

You can access this through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/unmonitorbuttonicon.jpg button or by using its keyboard shortcut equivalent (Ctrl-I).

Syncless cares about the safety of your removable drives. Unmonitoring will stop all monitoring actions on any folders that are currently in seamless mode, thus allowing the removable drive to be safely removed.

=== 6. Configure Filter Properties ===

==== Create a Filter ====
Click the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/detailsbuttonicon.jpg button in the toolbar to open up the tag properties panel. Inside the properties panel, choose the *Filtering* property. You should see a list of filters and it will likely be blank since no filters have been added yet.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tag_Configuration1.jpg

Now, click on the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Add_Filter_Button.jpg button to add a new filter. You can now set the "Ext. Mask" and the "Mode".

==== Construct a Filter ====
Ext. mask can be an actual filename, or simply a name with wildcards. Some examples will be "Storyboard.ppt", "`*`.exe" or "File?.txt".

  * *`*`* - Wildcard for any number of characters. For example, s`*`t will mean sit, sat, shoot, skit, etc.

  * *?* Wildcard for exactly one character. For example, s?t  will mean sit, sat, etc.

Mode can be set to exclusion or inclusion mode. If a filter is set to exclusion mode, then all files that match the ext. mask will be excluded. On the contrary, if a filter is set to inclusion mode, then all files matching the ext. mask will be included.

Now, let us look at some real-world examples. For example, if you want to include all Powerpoint files, but exclude a particular one, say "Introduction.ppt", you will create 2 filters:

  # Ext. Mask: `*`.ppt, Mode: Inclusion
  # Ext. Mask: Introduction.ppt, Mode: Exclusion

As seen from the above, creating a filter is a simple and intuitive task in Syncless.

== How to Configure Syncless? ==

You can personalize Syncless through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/App_Settings_Button.jpg button. After which, you will see a window with a list of settings.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Configure_Application_Settings.jpg

=== Enable Shell Integration ===

Syncless makes tagging easy for you by integrating directly into Windows Explorer. You can simply right-click on any folder you wish to tag. In the case where you rather not have this function, you can deselect *Enable Shell Integration* in settings.


=== Enable Window Animation on Application Start/Exit===

Syncless's main window will animate upon start up or exit. You may choose to disable the function by deselecting the *Enable Window Animation on Application Start/Exit* checkbox.

=== Enable Tray Notification ===

Syncless notifies you through tray notification upon initialization/completion of a synchronization. Enable or disable the function by deselecting the *Enable Tray Notification* checkbox.

=== When Minimizing, Minimize to Tray ===

Syncless can minimize to tray so that your task bar will be kept as clean as possible. However, if you wish to access Syncless more quickly through the task bar, you can disable the function by deselecting the *When Minimizing, Minimize to Tray* checkbox.

== How is Syncless User-friendly? ==

Syncless makes your user experience as pleasant as possible by providing several user-friendly functionalities.

=== Tag Name Auto Completion ===

Do you have a tag with a long name? Syncless understands the inconvenience you experience when trying to tag folders to a tag with a long name. As such, Syncless provides an auto-completion function when you type in a tag name.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tagname_Auto_Complete.jpg

Simply type in part of the tag name and Syncless will display the full name for you.

=== Filter Tag List ===

Do you have many tags to maintain and have difficulty finding that exact tag from the long list? Syncless supports filtering of tags so that you can search for the tag you want just by entering the tag name.

Let us say you have many tags in the tag list. 

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Zoom_In_All_Tag_List.jpg

You want to filter out only tags related to your photo folders. Simply enter the word 'Photos' in the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Search_Tag_Text_Box.jpg text box and only tag names containing 'Photos' will be displayed.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Zoom_In_Filter_Tag_List.jpg

=== Keyboard Shortcuts ===

Syncless helps you to save time and increase productivity by providing keyboard shortcuts to the many commonly used operations. Below is the list of keyboard shortcuts provided by Syncless.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Shortcut1.jpg

If you forget the shortcut keys, simply go to http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Shortcut_Button.jpg at the window toolbar and view the list again.

=== Accessing Tags Through Right-clicking ===

If you prefer right-clicking to clicking buttons, Syncless provides you the option to access your tags through context menu.

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Right_Click_Tag_List.jpg

Simply right-click on the tag under the tag list and you can choose to tag more folders, view tag properties or remove the tag.

=== Accessing Tagged Folders Through Right-clicking ===

Suppose you have many folders tagged with the same tag. When you want to view the folders in Windows Explorer, you will most probably have to go through Start Menu -> My Computer -> D: -> Your folders many times to open up the various folders. Why go through the hassle when you can simply open up the folders in Syncless?

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Right_Click_Tagged_Path.jpg

Simply right-click on the tagged path in the tag info panel and choose to Open in Windows Explorer or just double-click on it. The folder will be opened in Explorer Window. 

=== Tray Notification ===

Syncless allows you to perform other tasks as well when you synchronize large amount of files. You will still be kept updated of the synchronization status even when you are not viewing the Syncless main window.

Whenever a synchronization task is initiated or completed, Syncless will notify you through tray notifications. 

http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/Tray_Notification.jpg

=== Viewing Logs ===

You do not have to remember the changes you have made to your folders and files. Syncless keeps a log of the changes in your folders and files and lets you view them easily.

Access the event log through the http://big5sync.googlecode.com/files/logbuttonicon.jpg button.
