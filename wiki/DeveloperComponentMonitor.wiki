= Overview =
The *Monitor Component* provide a set of classes to detect file system changes. There are 2 roles for the *Monitor Component*. The first role is to be able to detect the insertion and removal of USB removable drive (external hard disk and flash drive) and the second role is to capture any changes to a file or folder.

=Detecting USB Removable Drive Event=
This is implemented using Windows Management Instrumentation. The code for the detection of USB device is referenced from:  http://dotnetslackers.com/community/blogs/basharkokash/archive/2008/03/15/USB-Detection-source-code.aspx

=Capturing File/Folder Changes Event=
This is implemented using `FileSystemwatcher` from the C# library. The `FileSystemWatcher` was extended to handle extra cases that the original `FileSystemWatcher` cannot handle.
