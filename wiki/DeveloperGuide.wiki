= System Overview =

== Architecture ==
        
Following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, the system is split into User Interface (UI) and System Logic Layer (SLL). The UI is completely separated from SLL. The SLL uses a facade pattern. It is further divided into several sub-components, all of which work independently of one another.

Communication between the UI and the SLL is done through a Service Locator and an Interface. This allows us to change the SLL without affecting the UI. On top of that, this also allows other developers to create their own user interfaces to work with SLL.

=== Data Storing ===
      
Syncless uses various XML files to store information. XML was chosen as it is more readable and portable. Examples are tagging.xml and profiling.xml, which are stored in the root folder of the application. On top of that, some XML is also stored on the removable devices that the user has tagged. These XML files are use to communicate information between 2 computers. 

Finally, each folder that is tagged also have metadata stored in them. At the moment, the XML is stored in a folder {{{.syncless}}} and is hidden. In the future, we will move this metadata elsewhere as most users do not like seeing "unwanted" files appearing all over the place.

=== Interaction among Sub-Components ===

To understand how the SLL interacts with the other components to perform the main operations, refer to sequence diagrams [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/DeveloperSLLSequenceDiagrams here].
 
== System Components ==

=== Profiling ===

The Profiling component performs drive/computer recognization. It makes Syncless truly portable because of its ability to recognize different drives/computers by creating a Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) in each of them. It also performs conversion of a physical directory/file path to a logical address, and vice versa. This conversion is necessary, because !CompareAndSync only recognizes physical path while Tagging recognizes a logical path.

=== Tagging ===

The Tagging component provides the underlying operations of creating and removing tags, as well as tagging and untagging folders from tags. It also manages other settings such as the filter settings per tag.

=== !CompareAndSync ===

The !CompareAndSync component in Syncless is the part of the system that handles the comparison and syncing of files and folders. From a logical point of view, it can be briefly split into 2 subcomponents; the manual subcomponent that handles all manual operations, and the seamless subcomponent that handles all the automated synchronization requests from another component, the Monitor.

=== Monitor ===

The Monitor Component provides a set of classes to detect file system changes. There are 2 roles for the Monitor Component. The first role is to detect the insertion and removal of USB removable drives, such as external hard disk and flash drive, and the second role is to capture any changes to a file or folder.

=== Logging ===

The Logging component is in charge of handling all user and debug logging actions. It is implemented using log4net with the Decorator pattern.

=== Filter ===
        
The Filter component provides a set of classes to cater to filtering folders and files. They can be used to filter default .syncless configuration files as well as archive files.

=== Notification ===

Coming soon.

=== User Interface ===

The User Interface (UI) component is in charge of handling all interactions between the user and the control layer. It is implemented using WPF for its powerful framework which allows for the creation of clean, professional look-and-feel. It also allows for the true separation of the UI from the System Logic Layer, allowing other developers to create their own UI to interact with our Logic Layer.

= Known Issues =
There are some known issues with V0.9, and they can be found [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/KnownIssues09 here].

There are some known issues with V1.0, and they can be found [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/KnownIssues10 here].

= Special Cases =
Syncless aims not to throw any kind of file or folder synchronization, and although it generally works as expected in most cases, there may be some sequence of actions that are handled differently. A list of these special cases can be found [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/SpecialCases here].        

= Testing Syncless =
It is a difficult process to test the seamless (real-time) mode in Syncless, as it would require a the tester to simulate a sequence of events randomly. Moreover, seamless mode depends on !FileSystemWatcher, and the events thrown by !FileSystemWatcher are largely undeterministic, and depending on the application that caused !FileSystemChange, the events thrown can be completely different, even for a simple action such as "Save".

Thus, we have come up with this seamless tester, which is quite different from a conventional test driver. It takes in a list of source folders, and a list of destination folders, and through a lot of randomization, changes will be simulated in the destination folders. At the end of the whole simulation (duration can be specified), all the files/folders in all the destination folders will be checked to see if the content is equal.

= Recommended Resources =
[http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/DeveloperGuideRecommendations These] are additional resources which may help the developer in understanding how to develop for Syncless further.

= References =
Throughout the development of this project, we referred to codes and solutions found in various places. All credits and references are given [DeveloperGuideReferences here].

= Glossary =
Syncless uses a few terms which may not be common in other synchronizations tools. For definitions of these terms, please check them out [http://code.google.com/p/big5sync/wiki/SynclessGlossary here].
