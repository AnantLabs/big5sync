     == 2.1. Tagging ==

        The Tagging component provides the underlying operations of creating/removing a 
        tag, tagging/untagging a folder to/from a tag, managing filter properties and 
        configuring tag properties.

     == 2.2. Profiling ==

        The Profiling component performs drive/computer recognization. It makes Syncless
        portable because of the ability to recognize different drives/computers by creating a 
        Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) in each of them. It also performs conversion of a 
        physical directory/file path to a logical address, and vice versa. This conversion is 
        necessary, because CompareAndSync only recognizes physical path while Tagging 
        recognizes a logical path.

     == 2.3. CompareAndSync ==

        The CompareAndSync component in Syncless is the part of the system that handles 
        the comparison and syncing of files and folders. From a logical point of view, it 
        can be briefly split into 2 subcomponents; the manual subcomponent that handles 
        all manual operations, and the seamless subcomponent that handles all the 
        automated synchronization requests from another component, the Monitor.

     == 2.4. Monitor ==

     == 2.5. Filter ==

     == 2.6. Logging ==

     The Logging component performs logging of messages produced when exceptions are 
     caught to a debug log file. It also logs user actions to a user log file.
