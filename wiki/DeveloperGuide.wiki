= 1. System Overview =

     == 1.1. Architecture ==
        
        Following the MVC model, the system into UI and Logic. The UI is developed 
        separately from the System Core logic. The logic layer follows a facade pattern. 
        It is further divided into sub components which will work together and complete 
        the job.

        Communication between the User Interface and Core Logic is done through a Service                   
        Locator and Interface. This allow us to change the logic without affecting the
        User Inteface. On top of that, this also allow other developer to create their own
        user interface to work with Syncless Core Logic.

     == 1.2. Data storing ==
      
        Syncless uses many files to store the information. We use XML to store the  
        information as it is more readable and portable. Examples are tagging.xml and 
        profiling.xml which are stored in the root folder of the application. On top of 
        that, the xml is also stored on removable devices that the user tag. These xml are 
        use to merge information between 2 computers. 

        Metadata of the folders are also stored in the folder itself in xml format. At the  
        moment, the xml is stored in the folder /.syncless and is hidden. In the future, 
        we are intending to move this to somewhere else to avoid creating too many folders 
        and files in the user's folders.

  
 
= 2. System Components =

     == 2.1. Tagging ==

        The Tagging component provides the underlying operations of creating/removing a 
        tag, tagging/untagging a folder to/from a tag, managing filter properties and 
        configuring tag properties.

     == 2.2. Profiling ==

        The Profiling component performs drive/computer recognization. It makes Syncless
        portable because of the ability to recognize different drives/computers by creating a 
        Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) in each of them. It also performs conversion of a 
        physical directory/file path to a logical address, and vice versa. This conversion is 
        necessary, because CompareAndSync only recognizes physical path while Tagging 
        recognizes a logical path.

     == 2.3. CompareAndSync ==

        The CompareAndSync component in Syncless is the part of the system that handles 
        the comparison and syncing of files and folders. From a logical point of view, it 
        can be briefly split into 2 subcomponents; the manual subcomponent that handles 
        all manual operations, and the seamless subcomponent that handles all the 
        automated synchronization requests from another component, the Monitor.

     == 2.4. Monitor ==

        The Monitor Component provides implementations to monitor the file system and 
        drives. This is used to detect drives changes and to provide synchronization when 
        a device is plugged in. The component monitor changes in the file system to detect 
        changes in the files and folder to synchronize them.

     == 2.5. Filter ==
        
        The Filter Component provides a means to filter files and folders to synchronize a 
        specified set of files/folders. This is to provide an easy way to extend this    
        feature into future instead of coupling it in the Tagging Component.

     == 2.6. Logging ==

        The Logging component performs logging of messages produced when exceptions are 
        caught to a debug log file. It also logs user actions to a user log file.
